# 🧠 Encapsulation in OOP (TypeScript Edition)

Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The others are **Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.

## 🔒 What is Encapsulation?

**Encapsulation** means **binding data (variables)** and **methods (functions)** that operate on the data into a single unit — typically a **class** — and **restricting direct access** to some of the object's components.

> ✅ It protects the internal state of an object and only allows controlled access via **getters** and **setters**.

---

## 🧱 Key Benefits of Encapsulation

- ✅ Improved **security** of data  
- ✅ Easy **code maintenance**  
- ✅ **Hides complexity** from the user  
- ✅ Prevents **unauthorized access** and modification

## 🛠️ Example in TypeScript

```ts
class BankAccount {
  private accountNumber: string;
  private balance: number;

  constructor(accountNumber: string, initialBalance: number) {
    this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
    this.balance = initialBalance;
  }

  // Getter method
  public getBalance(): number {
    return this.balance;
  }

  // Deposit money
  public deposit(amount: number): void {
    if (amount > 0) {
      this.balance += amount;
      console.log(`Deposited $${amount}. New Balance: $${this.balance}`);
    } else {
      console.log("Invalid deposit amount");
    }
  }

  // Withdraw money
  public withdraw(amount: number): void {
    if (amount > 0 && amount <= this.balance) {
      this.balance -= amount;
      console.log(`Withdrew $${amount}. Remaining Balance: $${this.balance}`);
    } else {
      console.log("Invalid or insufficient funds");
    }
  }
}
```

### 🧪 Usage

```ts
const myAccount = new BankAccount("1234567890", 1000);

// Accessing balance via getter
console.log("Balance:", myAccount.getBalance());

// Trying to deposit
myAccount.deposit(500);

// Trying to withdraw
myAccount.withdraw(300);

// ❌ This will throw an error because `balance` is private
// console.log(myAccount.balance); // Error: Property 'balance' is private
```

## 🔍 Explanation

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `private` | Keeps `accountNumber` and `balance` hidden from outside the class |
| `public` | Allows safe methods like `getBalance`, `deposit`, and `withdraw` to interact with private data |
| `getBalance()` | A **getter** that safely returns the balance |
| `deposit()` & `withdraw()` | Validate data before changing internal state |

---

## 🎯 Summary

- Encapsulation = **Data hiding + Controlled access**
- Use `private` keyword to hide sensitive properties.
- Use `public` methods (getters/setters) to interact with those properties **safely**.
- Protects internal logic and maintains integrity of data.
